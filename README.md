# React + Vite Setup and Toast Notification Demo

This project is set up with Vite, providing a modern development experience with fast refresh and optimized build times. Additionally, this project includes a demo showcasing how toast notifications work in React.

## Toast Notification Demo

This demo demonstrates a simple toast notification system implemented in React. Toast notifications are temporary messages that appear on the screen to provide feedback or alerts to the user. In this example, you can see how to:

- **Add New Toasts**: Click the "Get Massage" button to create a new toast notification.
- **Automatic Removal**: Each toast notification will automatically disappear after 5 seconds.
- **Manual Removal**: Click the close icon to remove a toast notification manually.
